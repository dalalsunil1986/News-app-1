# School Project - Android app
This is a repository for an application that is being developed for a school project - an Android news application that works locally using SQLite databases on android systems.
This repository will be updated almost daily or when something is finalized and is fully working, and notes for the update will be written down in the readme file (here) with the date of the update. Each commit will have the date of the update in the comment to help distinguish updates.

## Update 11/OCT/2017:
Created repository, added README.md
